# Ping-Pong-Game-on-Zedboard
This projectâ€™s idea is to create the Pong game running on Zedboard with a monitor connected to it. The game is implemented from scratch, it has the two pads and a ball drawn on the screen and the background is painted in different color. Everything is implemented in hardware on the FPGA, so this way at the end one can convert the implementation to create an ASIC with the Pong game. The goal is to create the Pong game on a single chip.
